Survival Mode setup
First, get bsdif using this terminal command:
sudo apt-get install bsdiff
Now you need to download the patch.
Move the patch to the /opt/minecraft-pi folder
sudo bash
chown pi minecraft-pi (to change the owner of the file to your user not root)
(DON'T CLOSE THE TERMINAL)Right click the minecraft-pi folder, Properties, Permissions, Change Content, and set to Anyone.
bspatch minecraft-pi mcpipatched survival.bsdiff
Now you should have a mcpipatched file inside your minecraft-pi folder. Rename that file to minecraft-pi but before you do this rename the current minecraft-pi file to anything else you want and THEN rename mcpipatched to minecraft-pi.
sudo cp minecraft-pi minecraft-pi-stock
sudo cp mcpipatched minecraft-pi
Now launch Minecraft Pi from the Games list and have fun!
